# pygame-circle-state

This 'app' shows the state of 2 circles given their radii and the distance between their centers.
It uses pygame to show a visualization of the circles with the correct ratios. I have also used pygame_textinput to input the dimensions

## Usage

You need to have pygame installed. When running the script, a window should appear. To change a parameter, click on the grey area around the number, use the keyboard to input the new number and click outside the area to update the visual.
